# GATOR CLI TOOL

GATOR is a CLI tool that allows users to:

1. Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
2. Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
3. Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
4. View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post

The tool uses Go to aggregate feeds into a Postgres SQL database, therefore you will need to install:

1. Go Version xxx
2. Postgres Version xxx
